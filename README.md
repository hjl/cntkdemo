Examples for Computational Network Toolkit (CNTK)

Get CNTK from https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK :

	git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK  or 
	clone https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK (Visual Studio)

There are pre-built binaries for Windows and Linux on Github, so you can use CNTK without building it yourself. 

If you do want to build it from source, CNTK itself is written in C++, with CUDA support. You can still run it without a GPU, just slower.
